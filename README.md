Google Cloud Endpoints with Google Cloud Run

I will follow [this](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/get-started-cloud-run) tutorial.

## Deploying sample service on Google Cloud Run

1. In the GCP [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) go to the **Manage resources** page and create a project.
2. Enable billing to the project following [this](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) tutorial.
3. Make a note of the project ID and project NUMBER. On the rest of this page, this project ID and project NUMBER is referred to as PROJECT_ID and PROJECT_NUMBER.
4. Download and install the Google Cloud SDK following [this](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) tutorial.
